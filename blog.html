    <p style="color: #150443" class="blogtext">Employed by Artitech as the lead draftsman for the 
        installation of Barrisol stretch-ceiling for Mecca 
        Cosmetica’s Sydney flagship store opening on Market 
        street. My brief for this project was to measure up 
        sixteen ceilings, create models in CAD and Adobe Illustrator 
        and liaise with Barrisol in both Melbourne and France. 
        I also worked on-site to install the ceilings,
         custom-designed and 3D printed hardware and 
         modified drawings in response to unforeseen site 
         conditions.</p>

<p style="color: #150443" class="blogtext">Designed in collaboration with Big Kahuna Imagineering
     and non-for-profit organisation Western Australia 
     Return Recycle Renew (WARRRL). Made from 10,000 
     recycled bottles - it is a visual representation 
     of how many drink containers are consumed every four 
     minutes in WA. This commissioned piece was created to 
     shine a light on the waste issue in WA and the launch
      of the “Containers For Change”. The Swan was installed 
      in Perth’s Yagan Square in October 2020.</p>

<p style="color: #150443" class="blogtext">I recently created a web face design for sporting startup Rook. Rook develops bottles specifically designed to be used while wearing boxing gloves. 

    After establishing an objective statement, strategy statement and conducting competitor and audience analysis, a number of options were developed directed towards their target market. 
    
    San-serif typeface Roboto was chosen to signal a rigid-rhythm appropriate for a combat sport. The colour of Midnight Express couples well with Gray90 and Dark Tangerine creates strong focal points on the screen. Overall this colour pallet conveys a brand of performance and grit. 
    
    Wireframes and required affordances were then developed before adding media. 
    
    Rook will launch in 2021 when group boxercise classes return. </p>

   <p style="color: #150443" class="blogtext">Designed in collaboration with Sphere Drones, these custom drone skins enable Surf Lifesaving Australia to identify their fleet of drones using individual asset numbers.
 
    The templates were developed for the Phantom 4, Mavic Pro 2 and the Mavic Mini drones. The skins are constructed from a polymeric cast vinyl as its properties allow for it to be wrapped on organic and non-geometric shapes. The decal skins are printed using eco-solvent inks and are matte-laminated to protect them from UV damage, scuffing and moisture before they are die-cut to shape. 
    
    The skins have now also been customised for Sydney Trains and the Sutherland Shire.</p>

<p style="color: #150443" class="blogtext">ZENON was designed in collaboration with young designers
     James Anderson and Sasa Barnes as part of the international 
     Next-Gen Mask Competition. <br><br>
    The avant-garde head-piece, aims to reconceptualise the 
    traditional mask and remove the stigma associated with 
    wearing them. With unique collaborations and social exposure,
    want it to be considered a collectable, akin to the world of 
    the sneaker trade. Driven by social media campaigns we would 
    create excitement around the biannual release of our distinctive 
    and trend challenging masks. We want our design to be constantly evolving,
     generating high demand for technical protective gear. <br><br>
    We choose our clothes, we choose our accessories and 
    we should be able to choose our masks. They need to be
     designed as more than just a medical device if you want
      to get adoption by the masses. ZENON aims to be the first
       high fashion medical grade mask.</p>
